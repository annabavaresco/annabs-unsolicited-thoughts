AnnaB is a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam, working on NeuroAI and vision-language interactions. If you're curious about her research, check out [her academic website](https://annabavaresco.github.io/).

When she's not doing her research, AnnaB enjoys taking pictures, reading, playing guitar, and sporadically writing blog posts with no expectations people will read them.
